# Contributing to tohoku_bootcamp
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## To Collaborators
- manuscript: only upload a pdf or a TeX compiled pdf. Do not upload the source files.
- code: unless necessary, please upload scripts only (not notebook).
- data: upload public data only. If the data contains personal information, please remove it.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
