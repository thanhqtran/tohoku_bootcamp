Abstract

We focus on how to conduct empirical analysis based on regression and causal inference.
Concentrate on empirical methods, understanding the framework, interpreting the results, and checking for robustness.

But we do not focus on theoretical (may be a little bit but without details) framework and proofs.

We recommend Prof. Ko’s Advanced Econometrics I & II if you are interested in the theoretical frameworks behind the empirical methods. 

Statistical Softwares used in this lecture are R and Stata.
